/*
 * PRAXIS INFO
 * Code associated with the scanning teaching unit in: 
 * http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/
 * The word and PPT documents created for the unit describe the purpose and 
 * motivation for this unit in great depth. They form an alternative mechanism
 * to answer at least some of the Sakai questions.
 * 
 * The questions  the scanning Sakai quiz should be answerable
 * after doing the exercise. You can write answers in draft form in the code,
 * or directly answer the questions in Sakai.
 * You may display the quiz and Eclipse window side by side. We have made
 * an attempt to keep the length of these commented lines small (80 chars).

 * Some of the questions raised by this praxis are:
 * 
 * What is the purpose of a package?
 * What is the purpose of an import?
 * What is the purpose of putting constraints on the header of any method?
 * What is the purpose of a main method, that is, why distinguish main from other methods?
 * What is the purpose of the argument to the main method?
 * What is the practical benefit of modularity in {@link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}?
 * How can we improve the modularity of {@link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}?
