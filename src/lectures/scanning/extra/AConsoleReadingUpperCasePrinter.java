 * RUNNING A PROGRAM
 * This is an example of a Java program containing an executable class.
 * Let us start by executing this class.
 * 
 * There are many ways to execute a class,
 * If you are editing the class and your insertion point is in it,
 * Right click->Debug As->Java Application is one way.
 * Use it or some other way you know to run this program.
 * 
 * If you do not see the Java Application option in Debug As, or your get a 
 * console message:
 * "Cannot run or load class"
 * then your project is misconfigured and you to delete the
 * jar file from the class path.
 * 
 * Look at the ObjectEditor PPT
 * http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/Lectures/ObjectEditorLib.pdf
 * on importing JavaTeaching  on how to do so. You have to select
 * the project then Right Click->Properties->Build Path->Libraries. 
 * Select oeall22.jar (it should be red, and remove it. 
 * You will get a bunch of errors now but you can do the praxis. Look at
 * the objecteditor ppt on how to add your downloaded oeall to the class/build path.

 * Lesson Comment:
 * 
 * A class (named AConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter below) may be contained in 
 * a named hierarchical package much as a file can be in a named hierarchical folder
 * This class is in a package called scanning which is a sub-package of lectures.
 * In fact, for each package, the OS creates a folder and for each class in a 
 * package it creates a file in the folder of its package.
 * This correspondence means that two different packages can 
 * contain classes with the same short name. However a package cannot 
 * contain two classes with the same name.
 * A package name should start with a lower case letter.

	 * T/F A main method can have a int argument.
	 * T/F Constraints put on the header of the main method makes it easier for
	 *  a human being to find it in the containing main class
	 * T/F Constraints put on the header of the main main method make it easier
	 *     for the Java interpreter, which executes a main method, to find it in the containing class.
	 * T/F Constraints put on the header of the main method can prevent 
	 *     programming errors such as returning a value that is not processed by the interpreter.
	 * 
	 * What happens if you use each of the following headers for main instead? 
	 * Can you execute the program?
	 * You cannot execute the program if you do not see the Java Application option 
	 * in the Run As or Debug As menu command, or if you see the console message, 
	 * cannot find or load main method.
	 * 
	 * Comment out the header above and uncomment the following to see what happens?
	 * Does the program compile? 
	 * Can the program be executed - do you get an option to run it?
	 * You can comment and uncomment a set of selected lines using the 
	 * shortcut CTRL/
	 * In the case of a single line, it is sufficient to have the insertion point 
	 * in the line.
	 * 
	 * This exercise shows that a method with an arbitrary header cannot be
	 * considered a main method. To understand why such constraints are necessary,
	 * consider two entities, the Java interpreter and a human reading your code,
	 * that must be able to search for the main method.
	 * When you execute a class, the Java interpreter must find the method so
	 * it can execute it and pass it the expected parameters.
	 * When humans  reads your code, they must be able to determine the 
	 * starting method without relying on perhaps missing or obsolete comments.
