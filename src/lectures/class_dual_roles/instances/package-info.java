/**
 * Do this praxis after the statics praxis is in the package 
 * lectures.class_dual_roles.statics, 
 * which means you must go to its package-info.java file;
 * 
 *
 * You can learn the concepts in a quiz by doing hands-on programming using
 * a praxis or looking at a web resource mentioned in the quiz description.
 * 
 *
 * 
 * A praxis is a hands-on lesson about some programming concept that involves
 * visiting a series of classe.
 * .
 *
 * In this praxis, you will visit the following classes in this package.
 
 * {ALoopingFactorialSpreadsheet}
 * {InstantiatingFactorialSpreadsheetUse}
 * {PropertiesAnalyzer}
 * {AFactorialSpreadsheetPretender}
 * {AnotherFactorialSpreadsheetPretender}
 * {AnotherLoopingFactorialSpreadsheet}
 * {ANonBeanLoopingFactorialSpreadsheet}
 * {ALoopingFactorialSpreadsheetWithNonPublicVariables}
 * 
 * In Eclipse, to navigate to a class, click on the name of the class name and 
 * Press F3 or CTRL-click  (maybe Fn F3 or CMD F3, depending on your computer)
 * to automatically navigate to it. 
 * CTRL-click means hold the CTRL key down and press the left mouse button.
 * Hyphens in keyboard sequences can be ignored, they just separate the individual
 * keys.
 * 
 * To return back from a navigation command, press ALT-left arrow, that is
 * hold the ALT button and press the left arrow button
 * To move forward in your navigation history, press ALT-right arrow.
 * 
 * Try this:
 * Position the cursor somewhere in the name, ALoopingFactorialSpreadsheet 
 * Press CTRL-click to go to the class
 * Press ALT-left arrow to return to this file
 * Press ALT-right arrow to move forward again to ALoopingFactorialSpreadsheet
