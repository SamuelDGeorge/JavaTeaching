 * You can learn the concepts in a quiz by doing hands-on programming using
 * a praxis or looking at a web resource mentioned in the quiz description. 
 *
 * 
 * A praxis is a hands-on lesson about some programming concept that involves
 * visiting a series of classe.
 * 
 * Here, we  see ways and motivation for creating a program with multiple classes.
 * While only one class will be executable - have a main method - there will be
 * many supporting classes. In general, a parxis will ask your to change 
 * something in the code and 'see what happens'. Your  first instinct to see 
 * what happens is to try and run the class. However, many of these classes 
 * do not have a 'main' method (so they cannot be run). This implies that your  
 * are simply supposed to change the class and see the kind of compile errors 
 * shown in the Eclipse editor as opposed to running something to 
 * examine the output and find any errors in it. 
 * 
 * We see here a principle for decomposing code into multiple classes
 * and another for protecting the variables and methods in
 * them from external scrutiny. While decomposition has many benefits, it has
 * the disadvantage that the code is distributed. This means the program becomes
 * like the elephant in the story of the blind men and an elephant 
 * (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant),
 * which is understood differently based on which part we focus on. 
 * 
 * Use the F3 (or CTRL/CMD click) to navigate to the mentioned classes and methods and 
 * ALT <- to return back. Such navigation is crucial to understanding multi-component 
 * programs. Better still, you and your partners can have multiple classes
 * open in your editors so that you can view multiple classes simultaneously.
 * Introductory courses tend not to deal large components, so many of you will
 * grow up in this praxis. Expect to struggle, especially if you
 * have not used a programming environment as sophisticated as Eclipse. 
 * Remember, instructors are here to help you. You may want
 * to also have other resources open
 *
